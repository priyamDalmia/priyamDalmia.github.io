## Getting started

1. Register a GitHub account if you don’t have one and confirm your e-mail (required!)
2. Download the contents in the `package` folder and follow the templates inside.
3. Go to the repository’s settings (rightmost item in the tabs that start with “Code”, should be below “Unwatch”). Rename the repository “[your GitHub username].github.io”, which will also be your website’s URL.
4. Set site-wide configuration and create content & metadata.
5. Upload any files (like PDFs, .zip files, etc.) to the `pages/projects/` . They will appear at https://[your GitHub username].github.io/files/example.pdf.
6. Check status by going to the repository settings, in the “GitHub pages” section
